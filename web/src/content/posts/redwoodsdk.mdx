## Redwood is Evolving

Since the early days of [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com), our mission has been clear: to help developers build and deploy full-stack apps faster, smarter, and with confidence. That mission hasn't changed — but the platform has.

We are excited to share that our **focus is evolving** to a new direction: **[RedwoodSDK](https://rwsdk.com)** 🚀

## Why RedwoodSDK?

[RedwoodSDK](https://rwsdk.com) is the natural evolution of everything we learned while building and supporting RedwoodJS:

- 🌐 **Full-stack, composable, React framework built for Cloudflare**
- 🛠️ **Easy to follow Request/Response cycle, no magic
- ⚡ **Cloudflare-native deployments** with edge-first performance
- ☁️ **Built in Cloudflare services** including D1, Queues, KV, AI, and more (you choose)
- 🧠 **Built-in Realtime support**


You can deploy in seconds using:

```bash
pnpm release            # for production
pnpm release --env=staging  # for staging
```

Simple. Predictable. Powerful.

> "From idea to live app, RedwoodSDK is the fastest path we've ever built."

## RedwoodJS Isn't Going Anywhere

RedwoodJS will remain **fully supported**, with active maintenance and updates.

If you're building with RedwoodJS today:

- You're still in good hands.
- We'll continue to support you.
- Your app isn't going anywhere.

But if you're starting something new — or want the latest in speed, developer experience, and edge-native architecture — you'll love [RedwoodSDK](https://rwsdk.com).
