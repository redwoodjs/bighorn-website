## Background jobs
Redwood now has a [Background Jobs](https://docs.redwoodjs.com/docs/canary/background-jobs) system that allows you to create and execute background jobs in your Redwood app with ease. This is a powerful feature that can be useful for things like sending emails, processing images, or any other task that doesn't need to be done immediately.

Core team member Rob has an awesome introduction video covering this new feature.

## Easier SSR and RSC setup
It's easier than every to enable our experimental SSR and RSC features. You can now enable SSR or RSC with a single command without having to first upgrade to a canary version of Redwood.

## Storybook using vite
Our Storybook setup now uses Vite instead of the now removed Webpack. This means your storybook setup will be faster and more consistent with your underlying Redwood app.

## Docker support
We've added support for Docker in Redwood. You can now deploy your Redwood app anywhere that supports docker with ease. We have a guide on how to do this [here](https://docs.redwoodjs.com/docs/canary/docker).

## Upgraded versions of React, Prisma, Vite, and more
We've upgraded a number of packages in Redwood to their latest versions. This includes React, Prisma, Vite, and more. This means you'll be able to take advantage of the latest features and improvements in these packages.
